# iXMLService
##### iXMLService .Net Wrapper for IBM i

This project provides a .Net wrapper class library for accessing IBM i data using the XMLSERVICE program.
The original project was written in VB and does not have support for basic access authentication with Apache. Due to fundamental changes in some of the API, this will most likely not work as a drop in replacement for the original without a little bit of work on your part.
